        <strong>One hundred and ninety eight</strong> players were drafted
        before NFL quarterback Tom Brady in the year 2000. Over twenty years and
        seven Super Bowl wins later he is now the undisputed greatest to ever
        play the game of football. This simple React web application lets you
        search for NFL players and see who was selected before them.
