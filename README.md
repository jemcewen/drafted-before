# Past Drafts

NFL wide receiver Amon-Ra St.Brown was drafted with 112th pick in the 2021 draft. St.Brown was insulted that he was not selected earlier in the draft, and out of spite he memorized all 16 wide receivers drafted before him. Hearing [this story](https://www.si.com/extra-mustard/2022/08/17/detroit-lions-amon-ra-st-brown-lists-every-wide-receiver-drafted-before-him) inspired me to create this web application.

## Description

Past Drafts is a Single Page Application that pulls data from an ESPN API to display information about NFL players and when they were selected in the entry draft. Built with React, this project implements various react hooks including useContext, useReducer, useEffect and useState.

## Usage

To use the application, simply search for an NFL player and navigate to their page to view their draft position and a list of players selected before them. Additionally, these players can be filtered to view only the players that play the same position.

## Technology

This project was built using React and Tailwind. The data is pulled from an undocumented ESPN API which required some creativity to function as intended.
